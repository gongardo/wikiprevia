## Sharing knowledge on objective priors using an expert-moderate wiki

This site: Documents for the development of the Wikiprevia project

During the regular meeting of the OBayes section in ISBA 2016, it was presented the initiative to create a wiki to collect information about objective priors, moderated by the OBayes community. 

The idea is aimed at providing collegiate recommendations to the exponentially growing need of specifying `good' objective priors in particular applied situations. The project was well received and many people offered to help in the development of the wiki. Since then, in a preliminary step, a small group of these first volunteers (Jim Berger, Anabel Forte, Jesus Palomo and Gonzalo Garcia-Donato) have been working on the design and structure of the wiki that now is called wikiprevia.

The wiki can be visited [here](http://www.wikiprevia.org)
